- Image Processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image. Nowadays, image processing is among rapidly growing technologies. It forms core research area within engineering and computer science disciplines too.

## Types of Image Processing
  1. Visualization – Observe the objects that are not visible.
  2. Image sharpening and restoration – To create a better image.
  3. Image retrieval – Seek for the image of interest.
  4. Measurement of pattern – Measures various objects in an image.
  5. Image Recognition – Distinguish the objects in an image. 
  
## Current Version
- Currently, we provide jupyter notebooks for Image Enhancement, and Classifications tasks
